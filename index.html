                    There are two types of citations, structured and unstructured citations.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Structured Citations
                </h3>
                <p>

                    When setting up your citations one way to maximise your efforts is completing your local citation profiles in full. Although this sounds simple enough most companies register their listings only using their name, address, phone number and their hours of operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't just cover the basics. You'll want to utilise all features in your listing being as descriptive as possible including business logo, images, videos and much content as can.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Your business relies on customers visiting your store. Inaccurate citations of your business found online will confuse the search engines and may even lead your customer to a completely different destination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is bad for your online presence and in some cases detrimental to your bottom line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To maintain consistency of your NAP profile, itâ€™s important that your business name, address and phone number are mentioned the same across all of your listings. A few ways these details may show incorrectly are:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
                    <li>
                        A change in business name
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A change in business location
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A change in phone number
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Incorrect data input by you or others or software
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Keep track of all your listings in a spreadsheet, along with the login details and passwords. By ensuring you have these details at hand, you can easily log in at a later date and change the details when necessary.

                <br>
                <p>
                    If you are doing your own SEO citation building or you have hired multiple agencies in the past for your marketing efforts, it's likely your business has gained duplicate listings on a number of sites along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To maintain a clean profile and get the most value out of your link's, then cleaning up your profiles or inaccurate citations is one way you can improve your website's trust flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although local citation building can be long and tedious it's advised you to remove these listings either manually, by using a local SEO service or by using one of the many reputable automated services such as:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
                    <li>

                <p>
                    These services are highly recommended. However, they can either be pricey or limited to the number of directories that are available to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the more competitive industries, youâ€™ll have to go above and beyond these listings to outrank your competition.

                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    Once you have put in the hard work building quality citations and generating reviews, share those profile and reviews on social platforms and bookmarking sites like Pinterest for extra traffic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doing this will improve the page power and increase the value of the backlinks to your website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Choose which of your online directory profiles are most important for your SEO efforts, and ensure to add links where you can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll want to make sure the profiles you are linking to include a dofollow link to your website and have descriptive text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example the naked url (https://exaplewebsite.com) or the brand name (Example Website) or the main service you provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dofollow links with keyword rich anchor text will pass more power over links such as Visit Website or Click Here.

                    A good way to get in front of potential customers for free is a Google Business listing and registering to the major directories.

                <p>
                    In a nutshell, if you do not have local citations in place already, it is probably the number one move for your business to make right now.
